    "imageUrl": "https://picsum.photos/600/400?random=3",
    "content": "React Hooks have revolutionized the way developers build functional components in React. Introduced in React 16.8, Hooks allow you to use state, side effects, and other React features without writing class components. The most commonly used Hooks are useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer. useState lets you manage local component state, while useEffect handles side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM updates. useContext provides an easy way to access shared data without prop drilling, and useReducer is useful for managing complex state logic. Hooks promote cleaner, more readable code and encourage component reusability. They also simplify testing and maintenance by reducing the complexity of lifecycle methods. By mastering Hooks, developers can create dynamic, efficient, and modern React applications, leveraging the power of functional programming. Hooks have become an essential tool in every React developer's toolkit and are widely adopted in the community for building scalable applications."

    "content": "Blockchain technology is the foundation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its applications extend far beyond digital currency. At its core, blockchain is a decentralized ledger that records transactions in a secure, transparent, and immutable way. Each block contains a list of transactions and a cryptographic hash linking it to the previous block, ensuring data integrity. Decentralization means no single entity controls the network, reducing the risk of fraud or tampering. Beyond finance, blockchain can revolutionize supply chain management, voting systems, digital identity, and healthcare records. Smart contracts automate transactions without intermediaries, saving time and costs. As businesses explore blockchain adoption, understanding its principles, limitations, and potential use cases is crucial. While scalability and energy consumption remain challenges, the technology continues to evolve. Learning blockchain basics equips individuals and organizations to participate in the digital economy and leverage emerging innovations responsibly."
